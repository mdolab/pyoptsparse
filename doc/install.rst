Installation
============

Requirements
------------
pyOpt has the following dependencies:

* Python 2.7+ (Python 3.2+)
* Numpy 1.0+
* Swig 1.3+
* c/FORTRAN compiler (compatible with f2py)
* mpi4py
* six 1.13

Notes:

* In Windows MinGW is recommended if c/FORTRAN compilers are not available
* In Linux, the python header files (python-dev) are also required.
* Compatibility on Windows 64bit has not been tested

Building
--------

The recommended approach to using pyOptSparse is to install
inplace. This does not require root access. From the ``pyoptsparse``
directory run::
    
  >>> python setup.py build_ext --inplace

To use pyOptSparse in this case, the user should add the path of the
diretory containing ``pyoptsparse`` to the user's ``PYTHONPATH``
enviromental variable. For example, if the pyoptsparse directory is
located at::

  /home/user/hg/pyoptsparse

The required line in the .bashrc file would be::

  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/user/hg/

To install the ``pyOptSparse`` package in a folder on the Python search path 
(usually in a python site-packages or dist-packages folder) run:
    
>>> python setup.py install --user

This will install the package to ``~/.local`` which is typically found
automatically by Python. If a system wide install is desired the
command to run would be (requiring root access)

>>> sudo python setup.py install

Notes:
    
* You may want to uninstall any previous version of pyOpt before installing a new 
  version, as there may be conflicts.
* Some optimizers are licensed and their sources are not included with this distribution. 
  To use them, please request their sources from the authors as indicated in the optimizer 
  LICENSE files, and place them in their respective source folders before installing the package.
  Refer to specific optimizer pages for additional information.
* In Windows, if MinGW is used make sure to install for it the C, C++, and Fortran compilers and run:
  
  >>> python setup.py install --compiler=mingw32
  
* By default pyOpt will attempt to use compilers available on the system. To get a list of 
  available compilers and their corresponding flag on a specific system use:
  
  >>> python setup.py build --help-fcompiler

* To see a list of all available ``setup.py`` options for building run 
  
  >>> python setup.py build --help

* In macOS, you may need to force an update of gcc using ‘brew uninstall gcc’ followed by a fresh
  installation of gcc using ‘brew install gcc’ as ‘brew upgrade gcc’ can be insufficient if you
  have recently updated your macOS version.
