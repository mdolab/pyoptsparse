Installation Instructions
=========================

Requirements
------------
pyOptSparse has the following dependencies:

* Python 2.7, 3.7 or 3.8, though other Python 3 versions will likely work
* C and Fortran compilers.
  We recommend ``gcc`` and ``gfortran`` which can be installed via the package manager for your operating system.

Please make sure these are installed and available for use.
In order to use NSGA2 and NOMAD, SWIG (v1.3+) is also required.
If those optimizers are not needed, then you do not need to install SWIG.
Simply comment out the corresponding lines in ``pyoptsparse/pyoptsparse/setup.py`` so that they are not compiled.
The corresponding lines in ``pyoptsparse/__init__.py`` must be commented out as well.

Python dependencies are automatically handled by ``pip``, so they do not need to be installed separately.

.. note::
  * In Linux, the python header files (python-dev) are also required.
  * We do not support operating systems other than Linux.
    If you want to run this on macOS or Windows, you are on your own.

Installation
------------
The easiest and recommended way to install pyOptSparse is with ``pip``.
First clone the repository into a location which is not on the ``$PYTHONPATH``, for example ``$HOME/packages/``.
Then in the root ``pyoptsparse`` folder type::

  pip install .

For those not using virtual environments, a user install may be needed::

  pip install . --user

If you plan to modify pyOptSparse, installing with the developer option, i.e. with ``-e``, will save you from re-installing each time you modify the Python code.

It is also possible to install pyOptSparse by calling ``python setup.py install``, but this is not recommended.

.. note::
  Some optimizers are proprietary and their sources are not distributed with pyOptSparse.
  To use them, please follow the instructions on specific optimizer pages.
  
For those who intend to use pyOptSparse with IPOPT, OpenMDAO developers provide a `bash script <https://github.com/OpenMDAO/build_pyoptsparse>`_ that simplifies the installation of the optimizer with different linear solvers.

Testing
-------
pyOptSparse provides a set of unit and regression tests to verify the installation.
To run these tests, first install ``testflo`` which is a testing framework developed by the OpenMDAO team::

  pip install testflo

Then, in the project root directory, type::

  testflo . -v

to run all tests.

Update or Uninstall
-------------------
To update pyOptSparse, first delete the ``build`` directory, then update the package using ``git``.
For stability, users are encouraged to stick to tagged releases.
Install the package normally via ``pip``.

To uninstall the package, type::

  pip uninstall pyoptsparse

.. note::
  pyOptSparse can optionally run in parallel if a suitable ``mpi4py``
  installation exists. This will be automatically detected and
  imported at run-time.

  If you only want to run in parallel, you can
  force pyOptSparse to do so by setting the environment variable
  ``PYOPTSPARSE_REQUIRE_MPI`` to anyone of these values: ``['always', '1', 'true', 'yes']``
  If a suitable ``mpi4py`` is not available, an exception will be raised and the run
  terminated.

  If you explicitly do not wish to use ``mpi4py``, set the environment variable ``PYOPTSPARSE_REQUIRE_MPI``
  to anything other than those values. This can come in handy, for example, if your ``MPI`` installation
  is not functioning properly, but you still need to run serial code.
