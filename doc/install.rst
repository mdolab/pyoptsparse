Installation Instructions
=========================

Requirements
------------
pyOptSparse has the following dependencies:

* Python 2.7, 3.7 or 3.8, though other Python 3 versions will likely work
* C/FORTRAN compiler (compatible with f2py)

Please make sure these are installed and available for use.
In order to use NSGA2 and NOMAD, SWIG (v1.3+) is also required.
If those optimizers are not needed, then you do not need to install SWIG.
Simply comment out the corresponding lines in ``pyoptsparse/pyoptsparse/setup.py`` so that they are not compiled.
Python dependencies are automatically handled by ``pip``.

.. note::
  * In Linux, the python header files (python-dev) are also required.
  * We do not support operating systems other than Linux.
    If you want to run this on macOS or Windows, you are on your own.

Installation
------------
The easiest and recommended way to install pyOptSparse is with ``pip``.
First clone the repository into a location which is not on the ``$PYTHONPATH``, for example ``~/packages``.
Then in the root ``pyoptsparse`` folder type::

  pip install -e .

For those not using ``conda``, a user install is needed::

  pip install -e . --user

It is also possible to install by calling ``python setup.py``, but this is not recommended.

.. note::
  Some optimizers are licensed and their sources are not included with this distribution.
  To use them, please request their sources from the authors as indicated in the optimizer
  LICENSE files, and place them in their respective source folders before installing the package.
  Refer to specific optimizer pages for additional information.

Update or Uninstall
-------------------
To update ``pyOptSparse``, first delete the ``build`` directory.
Then update the package using ``git``.
For stability, stick to tagged releases.
Install the package normally via ``pip``.

To uninstall the package, type::

  pip uninstall pyoptsparse

.. note::
  ``pyOptSparse`` can optionally run in parallel if a suitable ``mpi4py``
  installation exists. This will be automatically detected and
  imported at run-time.

  If you only want to run in parallel, you can
  force ``pyOptSparse`` to do so by setting the environment variable
  ``PYOPTSPARSE_REQUIRE_MPI`` to anyone of these values: ``['always', '1', 'true', 'yes']``
  If a suitable ``mpi4py`` is not available, an exception will be raised and the run
  terminated.

  If you explicitly do not wish to use ``mpi4py``, set the environment variable ``PYOPTSPARSE_REQUIRE_MPI``
  to anything other than those values. This can come in handy, for example, if your ``MPI`` installation
  is not functioning properly, but you still need to run serial code.
