===========
pyOptSparse is an object-oriented framework for formulating and solving nonlinear constrained optimization problems in an efficient, reusable, and portable manner.
Some key features of pyOptSparse include:

- Object-oriented development, which maintains independence between the optimization problem formulation and its solution by different optimizers
- The use of sparse matrices throughout the code, to more efficiently handle large-scale optimization problems
- Parallel model execution under MPI, both for expensive analyses that must be done in parallel, and for parallel function evaluation when using certain gradient-free optimizers
- The optimization histories can be stored during the optimization process, and a partial history can also be used to hot-restart the optimization
- A post-processing GUI utility called OptView to analyze optimization results


pyOptSparse is a fork of `pyOpt <http://www.pyopt.org/>`_.
However, it is not backwards compatible with pyOpt and thus optimization scripts will need to be modified to use pyOptSparse.
