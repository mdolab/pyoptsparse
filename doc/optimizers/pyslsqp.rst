SLSQP
-----
SLSQP optimizer is a sequential least squares programming algorithm
which uses the Han–Powell quasi–Newton method with a BFGS update of
the B–matrix and an L1–test function in the step–length algorithm. The
optimizer uses a slightly modified version of Lawson and Hanson’s NNLS
nonlinear least-squares solver.
