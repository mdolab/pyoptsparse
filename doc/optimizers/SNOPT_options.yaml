iPrint:
  desc: Print File Output Unit (override internally in snopt?)

iSumm:
  desc: Summary File Output Unit (override internally in snopt?)

Print file:
  desc: Print file name

Summary file: 
  desc: Summary file name

Start:
  desc: This value is directly passed to the SNOPT kernel, and will be overwritten if another option, e.g. ``Cold start`` is supplied, in accordance with SNOPT options precedence.
  Cold: Cold start
  Warm: Warm start

Problem Type:
  desc: >
    This specifies the problem type for SNOPT.
  Minimize: minimization problem.
  Maximize: maximization problem.
  Feasible point: compute a feasible point only.

Derivative level:
  desc: >
    The SNOPT derivative level. Only "3" is tested, where all derivatives are provided to SNOPT.

Proximal iterations limit:
  desc: >
    The iterations limit for solving the proximal point problem.
    We set this by default to a very large value in order to fully solve the proximal point problem to optimality

Total character workspace:
  desc: >
    The total character workspace length.
    If ``None``, a default value of ``500`` is used, as recommended by SNOPT.
    If SNOPT determines that the default value is too small, the Python wrapper will overwrite the defaults with estimates for the required workspace lengths from SNOPT and initialize the optimizer for a second time.
    SNOPT might still exit with ``82``, ``83``, or ``84``, but this should automate the storage allocation for most cases.
    User-specified values are not overwritten.

Total integer workspace:
  desc: >
    The total integer workspace length.
    If ``None``, a default value of ``500 + 100 * (ncon + nvar)`` is used, as recommended by SNOPT.
    If SNOPT determines that the default value is too small, the Python wrapper will overwrite the defaults with estimates for the required workspace lengths from SNOPT and initialize the optimizer for a second time.
    SNOPT might still exit with ``82``, ``83``, or ``84``, but this should automate the storage allocation for most cases.
    User-specified values are not overwritten.
    

Total real workspace:
  desc: >
    The total real workspace length.
    If ``None``, a default value of ``500 + 200 * (ncon + nvar)`` is used, as recommended by SNOPT.
    If SNOPT determines that the default value is too small, the Python wrapper will overwrite the defaults with estimates for the required workspace lengths from SNOPT and initialize the optimizer for a second time.
    SNOPT might still exit with ``82``, ``83``, or ``84``, but this should automate the storage allocation for most cases.
    User-specified values are not overwritten.
    

Save major iteration variables:
  desc: >
    This option is unique to the Python wrapper, and takes a list of values which can be saved at each iteration to the History file.
    This specifies the list of major iteration variables to be stored in the history file.
    ``Hessian``, ``slack``, ``lambda`` and ``condZHZ`` are also supported.
