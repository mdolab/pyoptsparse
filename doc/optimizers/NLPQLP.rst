NLPQLP
======

NLPQLP is a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method which solves
problems with smooth continuously differentiable objective function
and constraints. The algorithm uses a quadratic approximation of the
Lagrangian function and a linearization of the constraints. To
generate a search direction a quadratic subproblem is formulated and
solved. The line search can be performed with respect to two
alternative merit functions, and the Hessian approximation is updated
by a modified BFGS formula.

NLPQLP is a proprietary software, which can be obtained `here <http://www.ai7.uni-bayreuth.de/nlpqlp.htm>`_.
The latest version supported is v4.2.2.
