save_major_iteration_variables:

    This option is unique to the Python wrapper, and takes a list of values which can be saved at each major iteration to the History file.
    The possible values are

    - ``alg_mod``: algorithm mode (0 for regular, 1 for restoration)
    - ``d_norm``: infinity norm of the primal step
    - ``regularization_size``: regularization term for the Hessian of the Lagrangian
    - ``ls_trials``: number of backtracking line search iterations
    - ``g_violation``: vector of constraint violations
    - ``grad_lag_x``: gradient of Lagrangian

    In addition, a set of default parameters are saved to the history file and cannot be changed. These are

    - ``inf_pr``: primal infeasibility
    - ``inf_du``: dual infeasibility (optimality measure)
    - ``mu``: barrier parameter
    - ``alpha_pr``: step size for primal variables
    - ``alpha_du``: step size for dual variables

    pyOptSparse uses the same parameter names as `IPOPT <https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/OUTPUT.html>`_ and `cyipopt <https://cyipopt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html>`_.
    Detailed descriptions of these parameter can be found in their documentations.
